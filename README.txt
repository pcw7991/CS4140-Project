Hello, I'm adding this after the completion of this project to explain some things. Firstly, to actually run this program correctly, you need to compile and run "Team.java". You could run the others independently, but that is not the intention - "Team.java" contains GUI options to navigate the different files already. Also, there may still be some existing bugs, since this was a course project that could not get fleshed out to perfection. 

Thanks for checking this out.
